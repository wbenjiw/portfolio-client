                  Driven by a passion for lean design and innovative web applications, my goal is to become a top-notch full stack developer. Building sites with a broad swath of modern web development technologies lets me explore the art of the possible in web design. My experience managing all levels of large-scale projects including UX and interface design, graphic arts, database design, RESTful APIs and data migration tools equips me to make substantial contributions to a broad scope of development projects.

                  I started my programming journey a couple years ago when I started working with Expressive Analytics. Throughout High School I wanted to be a doctor and had listed Pre-Med as my major when enrolling for college. However, when I started doing contracting work for my Brother's company I immediately fell in love with programming. I love the problem solving of software development, as well as the design aspect of front-end programming. I come from a strong background of graphic design and have always loved learning, problem solving, and doing independent study. Software Development has allowed for me to combine these passions into a single hobby.
